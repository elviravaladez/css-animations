# CSS Animation Practice

This is a repository for practice with CSS Animations. I created this repo as a way to document my learning via the instruction provided by [Devon Anderson](https://github.com/devonanderson).

### What I Learned

#### The 12 Principles of Animation
1. Squash and Stretch
2. Anticipation
3. Staging
4. Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose
5. Follow Through and Overlapping Action
6. Slow in and Slow Out
7. Arc
8. Secondary Action
9. Timing
10. Exaggeration
11. Solid Drawing
12. Appeal

#### Why CSS Animations are Helpful to the User
* They help us create more pleasant experiences for the user
* They decrease cognitive load on the user
* They create feedback
* They direct attention
* They can be delightful & give the user a spark of joy ðŸ¤—

#### 3 Rules to Follow when using CSS Animations
1. Keep it short 
2. Keep it simple
3. Keep it meaningful

#### Exposure to the Following CSS Properties
* @keyframes
* animation-name
* animation-duration
* animation-timing-function
* animation-iteration-count
* animation-direction
* animation-fill-mode
* animation-play-state

### Continued Development

After attending this lecture, I am excited to practice creating animated forms that provide a great experience for the user. Keeping the 3 rules in mind, I will keep the animations simple, short, and meaningful. ðŸ˜Š
